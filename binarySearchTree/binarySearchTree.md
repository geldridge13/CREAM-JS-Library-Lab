For our last data structure, we chose a Binary Search Tree (BST). A tree is a non-linear data structure meaning that it does not traverse or move about sequentially. More specifically, a tree is a collection of nodes that are connected by some edges. For BSTs, the tree starts off with one node called the root node. Every node in a BST may have up to two children (hence binary) and these children are often referred to as the left and right child. The value of the left child will always be less than the value of its parent node. Just like the value of the right child will always be greater than the value of its parent node. When a new node is created the BST will compare the value of that new node to the root node value. If the value of the new node is less than the value of the root node the value will then traverse down the tree to the left child node. From there the value of the new node will be compared to the children of the left node, and this will recur until it finds a node with a value of null (meaning that the new node has reached the end of the branch) and then the new node will be added to the BST. BSTs are helpful in any situation where elements can be compared in a less than/greater than manner. BSTs have the benefits of linked lists and arrays and are more useful when dealing with large batches of dynamic data. However, compared to linked lists, searching through a BST is very slow. The sequential storage of a BST may waste time when it is not a complete binary tree, meaning that the left and right branches are not relatively symmetrical.
