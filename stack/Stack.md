A stack is a list of elements that are accessible only from the top end of the list. A real-world example of a stack is the stack of trays at a cafeteria. Trays are always removed from the top, and when trays are put back on the stack after being washed, they are placed on the top of the stack. This is what is referred to as last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.

Because of the last-in, first-out nature of the stack, any element that is not currently at the top of the stack cannot be accessed. To get to an element at the bottom of the stack, you have to dispose of all the elements above it first.

The two primary operations of a stack are adding elements to a stack and taking elements off a stack. Elements are added to a stack using the push operation. Elements are taken off a stack using the pop operation.
